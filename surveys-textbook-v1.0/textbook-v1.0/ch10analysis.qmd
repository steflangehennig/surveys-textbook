## Analyzing Dichotomous Dependent Variables
We are going use the binomial distribution to simulate a dichotomous dependent variable, _y_, with a known relationship to an independent variable, _x_. We will then estimate the relationship using OLS, logistic, and probit regressions and compare the results. Along the way, we will talk about the differences in the modeling approaches.
